= Instructions:
== In the table actor, which are the actors whose last names are not repeated? 

For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list.


`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM
    actor
GROUP BY
    last_name
HAVING
    count(last_name) = 1;
```

== Which last names appear more than once? 

We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM
    actor
GROUP BY
    last_name
HAVING
    count(last_name) > 1;
```

== Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    count(*) AS total_rental_processed,
    staff_id
FROM
    rental
GROUP BY
    staff_id;

```

== Using the film table, find out how many films were released each year

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    release_year,
    count(*) AS number_of_films_released
FROM
    film
GROUP BY
    1;
```

== Using the film table, find out for each rating how many films were there

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    rating,
    count(*) AS count_of_films_per_rating
FROM
    film
GROUP BY
    1;
```

== What is the mean length of the film for each rating type? 

Round off the average lengths to two decimal places.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    rating,
    floor(avg(length)) AS film_mean_length_in_min
FROM
    film
GROUP BY
    1;
```

== Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    rating
FROM
    film
GROUP BY
    1
HAVING
    avg(length) > 2 * 60;
```
