xref:Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?[Bottom section]

The database is structured as follows:

= Instructions:
== In the table actor, which are the actors whose last names are not repeated? 

For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list.


`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM
    actor
GROUP BY
    last_name
HAVING
    count(last_name) = 1;
```

== Which last names appear more than once? 

We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once.
