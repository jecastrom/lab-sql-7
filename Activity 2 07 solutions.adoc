* Find out average transaction value by type.

    floor(avg(amount)) AS average_transact_amount,
    `type`

```

== Activity:

* As you might have seen in the previous query, there are 19 rows returned by this query. But there a few places where the column ``k_symbol`` is an empty string. Your task it to use a filter to remove those rows of data. After the filter gets applied, you would see that the number of rows have reduced.

`Answer:`

```sql
SELECT
    k_symbol,
    floor(avg(amount)) AS average_transact_amount
FROM
    trans
WHERE
    k_symbol != ' '
GROUP BY
    1;
```

FROM
    `client`
    INNER JOIN district ON `client`.district_id = district.A1
GROUP BY
    2
HAVING
    number_of_clients >= 100
ORDER BY
